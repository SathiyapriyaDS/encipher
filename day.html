<h1>Why do i want to learn HTML?</h1>
<p>I want to learn HTML because it is the basic language used to create all websites.
HTML helps me understand how a webpage is structured and how text, images, and links are displayed.</p>
<p>Learning HTML allows me to create my own webpages and projects.
I can build my own portfolio, resume website, or any simple webpage I need.
HTML is easy to learn and helps me turn my ideas into real websites.
</p>
<p>HTML is also the first step toward becoming a web developer.
Once I learn HTML, I can move on to CSS and JavaScript, which are used to design and add features.
Learning HTML opens the door to many opportunities in web development.</p>
